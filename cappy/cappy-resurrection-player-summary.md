## Your Return

You died protecting your companions in Wave Echo Cave, but death was not the end of your story. A necromancer made a pact with an entity known as the Bone Mother to bring you back to life. However, this gift comes with both power and... complications.

## New Ability: Necrotic Convergence

You have gained a powerful ability that enhances your druidic magic. When activated, you can choose one of the following benefits for 1 minute:

- **Unlimited Wild Shape:** Use Wild Shape as many times as you want during the duration (doesn't count against your daily uses)
- **Perfect Healing:** Your healing spells automatically restore the maximum possible hit points

**Uses:** 3 times per long rest (based on your proficiency bonus)
**Activation:** Bonus action
**Duration:** 1 minute

## What You Notice

- Your connection to nature feels subtly differentâ€”more intense, but somehow wrong
- Small animals seem more skittish around you than before
- Your touch occasionally causes flowers to wilt, though this may just be your imagination
- Sometimes you wake from dreams you can't quite remember, with the taste of ash in your mouth

## Moving Forward

This power could be invaluable to your party. The pact that brought you back has left its mark, though the full implications remain unclear.
